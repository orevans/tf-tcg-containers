# TerraFERMA v2.0/ThermoCodegen v0.6.1  docker image

Welcome!

This docker image contains a complete installation of TerraFERMA and ThermoCodegen, alongside their dependencies, PETSc, FEniCS and SPuD, within an Ubuntu 18.04LTS OS.

The environment variables have been set automatically using environment modules and it should now be possible to build and run both 
TerraFERMA and ThermoCodegen models within this container. Opening the diamond GUI (and other visualization tools) depends on having forwarded the
X11 connection correctly from this docker container to the local machine.  Additionally the `shared` directory is available to use 
as shared volume with the local machine but depends on the correct configuration being used at startup.  See:

    https://github.com/terraferma/terraferma/wiki/Installation#docker

for information on how to do this.
